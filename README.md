# Cloud Resume Challenge

This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS Version). It includes:
- A static frontend hosted on S3 and distributed via CloudFront.
- A backend using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

**Please note:** This project is currently in an early, experimental phase and contains work-in-progress commits. I am actively refining and improving the implementation as I continue to build my portfolio of freelance cloud and GIS automation services. While the project is evolving, it already demonstrates my approach to cloud-based automation and Python scripting workflows. Please feel free to explore the code and reach out if you would like help customising similar solutions for your needs.
